# QuickHAC Version 3.0 Mockups

## Things Users Would Like to See Improved

- "Maybe a notifications chart, sometimes i dont get the notification and i dont know what changed"
- "When u click the icon it pops out. When you click it again it should dissapear. not just refresh another popout"
- "Standalone app rather than a chrome extension"
- "Also, comparison to other quickhacers who make their grades "public" (or comparison to the average)"
- "Maybe also add in a feature to check attendance. Then it would make actually going to HAC superfluous."
- "Ability to permanently change my grades"
- "If possible, a notification for when a new grade is entered even if it doesn't change a grade average"
- "Possibly GPA calculation"
- "I would like to see what assignment made my grade change when I get a notification."
- "Grades table looks too busy/cramped. Also the grade cells don't have the same width (Semester averages)"
